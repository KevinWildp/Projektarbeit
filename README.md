1. Description
This project focuses on implementing a machine learning model for predicting the outcome of soccer matches, with the goal of achieving the highest possible prediction accuracy. A Random Forest algorithm is used as the core machine learning model, which uses various match-related data such as team performance, statistics, and other relevant features to predict whether a team will win, lose, or draw. By analyzing historical match data, the model is designed to optimize the accuracy of future football match predictions.
